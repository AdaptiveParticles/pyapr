"""
Interactive APR conversion. Reads in a selected TIFF image for interactive setting of the parameters:
    Ip_th       (intensity threshold)
    sigma_th    (local intensity scale threshold)
    grad_th     (gradient threshold)

Use the sliders to control the adaptation. The red overlay shows (approximately) the regions that will be fully
resolved (at pixel resolution).

Once the parameters are set, the final steps of the conversion pipeline are applied to produce the APR and sample
the particle intensities.

Note: The effect of grad_th may hide the effect of the other thresholds. It is thus recommended to keep grad_th
low while setting Ip_th and sigma_th, and then increasing grad_th.
