    """
    Compute a binary segmentation by constructing a particle graph and applying the max-flow algorithm [1]
    using the implementation maxflow-v3.04 [2].

    The graph is formed by linking each particle to its face-side neighbours in each dimension.
    Terminal edge costs are set based on a smoothed local minimum estimate and the local standard deviation, while
    neighbour edge costs are set based on intensity differences, resolution level and the local standard deviation.

    Note: The procedure to compute edge costs is highly experimental, and can likely be improved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    apr: APR
        Input APR data structure.
    parts: ShortParticles or FloatParticles
        Input particle values.
    alpha: float
        Scaling factor for terminal edge costs. (default: 1.0)
    beta: float
        Scaling factor for neighbor edge costs. (default: 1.0)
    gamma: float
        Edge costs between neighboring particles are set as ``exp(-dI^2 / (gamma * sigma^2))``, where dI is the intensity
        difference and sigma is 1 if ``constant_neighbor_scale`` is True, otherwise the local standard deviation of the
        gradient magnitude. (default: 1.0)
    constant_neighbor_scale: bool
        If True, neighbor edge costs are scaled by a constant value (see ``gamma``). (default: False)
    z_anisotropy: float
        Gradients and differences in the z-dimension are scaled by this value. (default: 1.0)
    intensity_threshold: float
        Lower threshold on absolute intensity. Particles with intensity below this threshold are considered background.
        (default: 0)
    min_std: float
        Regions where the local standard deviation is lower than this value are considered flat, and both
        terminal energies are set to 0 such that the result depends solely on neighbor information. (default: 0)
    std_window_size: int
        Size of the window used to compute local standard deviation. (default: 7)
    num_levels: int
        Terminal costs are only set for particles at the ``num_levels`` finest resolution levels. (default: 2)
    max_factor: float
        Particles brighter than ``max_factor`` (local) standard deviations from the local minimum estimate
        are considered foreground. (default: 3.0)
    avg_num_neighbors: float
        Controls the amount of memory initially allocated for edges. If memory is being reallocated,
        consider increasing this value. (default: 3.3)
    num_tree_smooth: int
        Number of smoothing iterations to perform on tree particles to compute the local minimum estimate. (default: 3)
    num_part_smooth: int
        Number of smoothing iterations to perform on the APR particles to compute the local minimum estimate. (default: 3)
    push_depth: int
        The local minimum estimate is coarsened by ``push_depth`` levels. (default: 1)
    z_block_size: int, optional
        If provided, the operation is applied block-wise in the z dimension to reduce memory requirements.
        The amount of overlap is controlled by ``z_ghost_size``. (default: None)
    z_ghost_size: int
        If ``z_block_size`` is provided, the blocks are padded with ``z_ghost_size`` slices in both directions
        to reduce boundary artifacts between blocks.
    output: ByteParticles or ShortParticles, optional
        Particle object to which the resulting mask is written. If None, a new ByteParticles object
        is generated. (default: None)

    Returns
    -------
    output: ByteParticles or ShortParticles
        The binary segmentation mask resulting from the minimum cut.
