Documentation for pyapr
=======================

Content-adaptive storage and processing of volumetric images in Python.

`pyapr` is a collection of tools and algorithms to convert images to and from the
Adaptive Particle Representation (APR), as well as to manipulate and view APR
images. The base namespace `pyapr` holds a number of data container classes
(see data_containers), while functions for generating, viewing and processing APR
images are imported via submodules.
